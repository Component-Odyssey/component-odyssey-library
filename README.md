# Component Library Starter

The companion repo to [Component Odyssey](https://component-odyssey.com).

This is the repo that you'll be using throughout the entire course to build out your component library.

The repo is split into two folders:

- "code"
- "lesson-guides"

**code**

This is the folder that you'll be adding your code to throughout the course. Each lesson will build off of the previous one, so keep working in the same folder.

**lesson-guides**

This folder contains the finished code for each lesson. You can take a look in these folders if you get stuck.

## Getting started

To get started, clone this repo using:

`git clone git@github.com:Component-Odyssey/writing-an-advanced-web-component.git`

Always check that you have the latest code by running `git pull` before you start working on a lesson:

`git pull`

Navigate to the "code" folder:

`cd ./code`

Install the dependencies:

`npm i`

Start the server:

`npm run start`

## Troubleshooting

If you have any problems, then please reach out in the Discord.
