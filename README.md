# Component Library Starter

The companion repo to [Component Odyssey](https://component-odyssey.com).

This is the repo that you'll be using throughout the entire course to build out your component library.

The repo is split into two folders:

- "code"
- "lesson-solutions"

**code**

This is the folder that you'll be adding your code to throughout the course. Each lesson will build off of the previous one, so keep working in the same folder.

**lesson-solutions**

This folder contains the finished code for each lesson. You can take a look in these folders if you get stuck.

## Getting started

To get started, clone this repo using:

`git clone https://github.com/Component-Odyssey/component-odyssey-library.git`

You should then create your own GitHub repo and push your version of the code to that repo. We run through this in the "Setting up Your Environment" lesson.

To ensure you have the latest changes and fixes I've made ot the starter repo, it's worth regularly pulling the changes I've made. You can do this by running:

`npx https://gist.github.com/andrico1234/19ba43f562c7b56cb3181b958ef17d57`

The above script pulls the latest changes from the original starter repo and merges them into your version of the code.

Once that's complete, you can navigate to the "code" folder:

Navigate to the "code" folder:

`cd ./code`

Install the dependencies:

`npm i`

Start the server:

`npm run start`
